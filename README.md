# PoE-character-build-manager
Backend project that allows users to manage their character builds.  Importing their character from their Path of Exile account, pulling from their character items, and passive tree. 
There will also be a filter that filters and sort through specific characters.  (This part might be a bit aspirational)

This project makes use of FastAPI, Pydantic, Postgres, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, and Alembic.
