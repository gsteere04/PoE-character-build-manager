# PoE-character-build-manager
Backend project that allows users to manage their character builds.  Importing their character from their Path of Exile account, pulling from their character items, and passive tree. 
There will also be a filter that filters and sort through specific characters.  (This part might be a bit aspirational)

This project makes use of FastAPI, Pydantic, Postgres, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, and Alembic.  

## UPDATE
Change of plans, pulling from the Grinding Gears Games API is crazy annoying.  If I learn how to do it efficiently, then I shall implement it.  Also storing account information and syncing it to the database also seems a bit too aspirational for me.
